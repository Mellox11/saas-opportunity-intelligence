## Performance Validation

**Bundle Size Targets:**
- Critical Path: <200KB (Authentication, Configuration, Basic Results)
- Analysis Features: <150KB (Charts, Detailed Views, Chat Interface)  
- Advanced Features: <100KB (Constellation Map, Voice Interface)
- Total Initial: <500KB with progressive loading

**Runtime Performance:**
- 60fps animations on desktop, 30fps graceful degradation on mobile
- <100ms interaction response times
- <500ms real-time update latency
- <2.5s Largest Contentful Paint on 3G networks

## Security Considerations

**Client-Side Security:**
