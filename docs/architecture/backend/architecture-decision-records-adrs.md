# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-002: Multi-Cloud Hybrid Infrastructure

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Context:** Need to optimize for specific workload characteristics while maintaining cost efficiency

**Decision:** Use Vercel for Next.js frontend/API + Railway for background workers + Pinecone for vector operations

**Rationale:**
- **Vercel Optimization:** Perfect Next.js integration, global CDN, automatic scaling for user-facing operations
- **Railway Simplicity:** Cost-effective background workers, simple deployment, integrated PostgreSQL/Redis
- **Pinecone Management:** Removes vector database operational complexity, provides cost monitoring APIs
- **Cost Predictability:** Each platform optimized for specific workload with transparent pricing

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Optimized performance and cost for each workload type, reduced operational complexity
- **Negative:** Multi-platform coordination complexity, vendor lock-in across multiple services
- **Mitigation:** Clear service boundaries enable migration, comprehensive monitoring across platforms

## ADR-003: TypeScript Enforcement Across Full Stack

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Context:** Financial accuracy requirements and complex AI cost calculations demand type safety

**Decision:** Enforce strict TypeScript across frontend, API routes, and workers with no-implicit-any

**Rationale:**
- **Financial Accuracy:** Type safety prevents billing calculation errors that could impact unit economics
- **API Contracts:** Strong typing between API routes and workers prevents integration bugs
- **Developer Experience:** Excellent tooling support and refactoring capabilities for rapid development
- **Maintenance:** Type checking catches errors early, reducing debugging time and production issues

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Reduced bugs, better developer experience, safer refactoring, improved documentation
- **Negative:** Slightly slower initial development, learning curve for complex type patterns
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive type libraries, team training, gradual adoption patterns

## ADR-004: Bull.js Queue System Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Context:** Need reliable job processing with progress tracking and cost monitoring

**Decision:** Use Bull.js with Redis backing store for all background job processing

**Rationale:**
- **Progress Tracking:** Built-in job progress monitoring essential for real-time cost tracking
- **Reliability:** Mature system with comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- **Monitoring:** Excellent dashboard and monitoring capabilities for queue health
- **Redis Integration:** Perfect integration with existing Redis caching strategy

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Reliable job processing, excellent monitoring, proven scalability patterns
- **Negative:** Redis dependency, additional infrastructure complexity
- **Mitigation:** Redis managed by Railway, comprehensive monitoring, fallback strategies documented
