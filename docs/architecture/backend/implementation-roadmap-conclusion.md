## Migration Paths for Future Improvements

### V2 Technology Migration Strategy

**Drizzle ORM Migration Path:**
```typescript
// Migration strategy from Prisma to Drizzle
export const migrationPlan = {
  phase1: 'Parallel implementation - new features use Drizzle',
  phase2: 'Gradual migration of existing Prisma queries',
  phase3: 'Complete Prisma removal and optimization',
  expectedGains: '40% query performance improvement',
  timeline: '4-6 weeks after V1 launch'
}
```

**Bun Runtime Migration:**
```typescript
// Runtime transition strategy
export const bunMigration = {
  compatibility: 'Test existing Node.js code compatibility',
  performance: '3x faster startup, 50% lower memory usage',
  features: 'Native TypeScript, built-in bundler',
  risks: 'Newer ecosystem, some packages may need updates',
  timeline: '2-3 months after stable V1 deployment'
}
```

**Multi-Model AI Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Advanced AI routing for cost optimization
export const aiOptimization = {
  strategy: 'Route tasks based on complexity and cost',
  providers: {
    creative: 'GPT-4 for brainstorming and creative analysis',
    analytical: 'Claude-3 for structured data analysis', 
    bulk: 'GPT-3.5 for simple classification tasks'
  },
  costSavings: 'Additional 20-30% beyond initial 30%',
  implementation: 'Gradual rollout with A/B testing'
}
```
