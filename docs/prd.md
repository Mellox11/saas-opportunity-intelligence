# SaaS Opportunity Intelligence Tool Product Requirements Document (PRD)

*Generated: 2025-08-07*
*Based on comprehensive Project Brief*

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable developers and indie hackers to identify profitable SaaS opportunities through AI-powered Reddit analysis
- Provide transparent usage-based pricing that aligns costs with actual value delivered
- Deliver comprehensive opportunity reports with anti-pattern detection in 5-10 minutes
- Establish technical foundation for dual vector database architecture supporting posts and comments analysis
- Create interactive chat interface for natural language opportunity querying
- Build pattern recognition engine for cross-subreddit opportunity validation
- Achieve positive unit economics with 75%+ gross margins on day one
- Support 10+ concurrent analyses while maintaining real-time cost tracking

### Background Context

The indie hacker and developer community faces a systematic failure in market validation, with 90% of projects failing due to building solutions without confirmed demand. Current approaches involve 20-40 hours of manual Reddit research per opportunity, leading to analysis paralysis and high opportunity costs ($10K-50K per failed project).

This PRD defines a comprehensive SaaS Opportunity Intelligence Tool that transforms unstructured Reddit discussions into actionable business opportunities through a sophisticated multi-stage AI pipeline. The solution addresses the core problem of signal-to-noise extraction from community discussions while providing transparent, usage-based pricing that aligns with project-based work patterns of the target market.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Primary Experience:** Cost-transparent, progress-driven analysis workflow where users feel in control of their spending and can see real-time value delivery. The interface should feel like a professional research tool with modern canvas-based design, emphasizing data quality and actionable insights through visual workflow representation.

**Design Philosophy:** "Transparent Intelligence" - every AI decision, cost calculation, and analysis step should be visible and explainable through intuitive visual workflows, building trust with technically-minded users who appreciate understanding how their tools work.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Modern Visual Design:** Clean, professional interface with subtle dot grid background patterns for visual texture, inspired by modern design portfolios and fintech applications like Mercury.com.

**Cost-First Workflow:** All user interactions begin with cost estimation and budget approval, making spending transparent and predictable before any analysis begins.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Analysis results presented in expandable cards and panels on the canvas, allowing users to drill down from summary to detailed breakdowns to raw data access.

**Conversational Intelligence:** Chat interface integrated into the canvas experience for querying results, supporting both simple questions and complex filters with visual highlighting of relevant data points.

**Real-Time Feedback:** Live progress indicators with cost tracking displayed as animated workflow nodes, showing exactly what the system is doing and how much it's costing.

### Core Screens and Views

**Analysis Configuration Page:** Clean form interface for subreddit selection, time range configuration, and keyword customization with dot-grid background patterns and cost estimation workflow

**Real-Time Progress Dashboard:** Modern dashboard with progress indicators, cost accumulation display, and ability to modify analysis mid-stream

**Opportunity Results Page:** Interactive grid of opportunity cards with filtering, sorting, and detailed view capabilities

**Chat Interface Panel:** Integrated chat sidebar or modal with suggested questions and saved query templates

**Analysis History Grid:** Past reports displayed as card thumbnails with hover previews, cost breakdowns, and quick access to saved opportunities

**Account & Billing Dashboard:** Clean, modern dashboard with usage analytics, cost visualization charts, payment methods, and spending controls

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure compliance with WCAG AA standards with particular attention to dark mode contrast ratios and canvas-based interaction accessibility patterns.

### Branding

**Visual Style:** Modern, clean aesthetic with subtle dot grid background patterns for visual texture. Clean typography, subtle shadows, and smooth animations create a premium feel that communicates "intelligent analysis." Alternative inspiration from Mercury.com's sophisticated fintech design.

**Color Scheme:** Comprehensive dark/light mode support with carefully calibrated contrast ratios. Dark mode as the default experience for developer-focused audience.

**Interactive Elements:** Smooth transitions, hover effects, and micro-interactions that feel responsive and polished without being distracting from data analysis tasks.

**Design Elements:** Dot grid backgrounds as subtle texture, rounded corner cards, subtle gradients, and clean spacing to create professional, modern appearance.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary:** Desktop-first responsive web application optimized for detailed analysis review and data exploration

**Secondary:** Tablet support for report reviewing and basic querying

**Dark Mode:** Full dark mode implementation as default, with light mode toggle available

**Out of Scope:** Native mobile apps (analysis complexity better suited for larger screens)

- **Billing Integration:** Stripe with comprehensive webhook handling and audit logging
- **Real-time Updates:** Smart polling with exponential backoff + WebSocket fallback

**Critical Decision Rationale:** Hybrid architecture solves Vercel timeout limitations while maintaining development simplicity. Clear service boundaries enable future microservice extraction when needed.

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** Focused testing pyramid emphasizing business logic and integration points:

- **Unit Tests:** Core business logic, cost calculations, AI response parsing
- **Integration Tests:** Reddit API integration, OpenAI classification accuracy, Stripe billing flows
- **End-to-End Tests:** Critical user journeys from analysis setup to payment completion
- **Manual Testing:** UI/UX validation for modern design system and dark mode

## Epic List

Based on comprehensive requirements and battle-tested through multi-perspective analysis, here are the strategically sequenced development phases:

**Epic 1: Core Value MVP** - Reddit analysis with basic AI scoring, simple payment integration, and minimal authentication to prove users will pay for AI-powered opportunity analysis within 6-8 weeks.

**Epic 2: Analysis Intelligence** - Enhanced AI pipeline with comment analysis, 10-dimensional scoring, anti-pattern detection, and comprehensive opportunity reporting to deliver competitive differentiation through analysis depth.

**Epic 3: Discovery & Scale** - Vector database integration, cross-subreddit pattern recognition, unlimited analysis scope, and advanced opportunity clustering to enable platform scalability and advanced insights.

**Epic 4: User Experience & Optimization** - Natural language chat interface, UI polish with dot grid design system, performance optimization, and cost efficiency improvements for user retention and margin improvement.

### Epic Structure Rationale:

**Market Validation Priority:** Epic 1 delivers working analysis with payment validation within 6-8 weeks, enabling rapid market feedback rather than building infrastructure without user validation.

**Balanced Complexity Distribution:** Epic sizing is more evenly distributed, avoiding the "foundation epic" trap that delays value delivery and the "mega-epic" trap that creates development bottlenecks.

**Risk Management:** Core technical risks (AI accuracy, cost tracking, Reddit API integration) are tackled in Epic 1-2 when iteration and pivoting are most feasible.

**Built-in Quality:** Production concerns, monitoring, and error handling are integrated throughout each epic rather than deferred to a separate "production readiness" phase.

**User Feedback Integration:** Each epic delivers deployable value that enables user testing and feedback to guide subsequent development phases.
