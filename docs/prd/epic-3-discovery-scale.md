# Epic 3: Discovery & Scale

**Epic Goal:** Enable platform scalability and advanced insights through vector database integration, cross-subreddit pattern recognition, unlimited analysis scope, and advanced opportunity clustering for comprehensive market intelligence.

## Story 3.1: Vector Database Integration

As a user seeking pattern-based insights,
I want the system to use semantic search and similarity matching,
so that I can discover related opportunities and emerging trends across discussions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All posts and comments stored in Pinecone vector database with OpenAI embeddings
2. Semantic similarity search identifies related opportunities across different subreddits and time periods
3. Similar opportunity clustering groups related problems with confidence scores
4. Vector search powers "Related Opportunities" section showing semantically similar problems
5. Embedding quality metrics ensure meaningful similarity matching (>80% user satisfaction)
6. Vector operations add <10% to total analysis cost with transparent cost tracking
7. Similarity threshold adjustable by users (strict vs loose matching) with clear explanations
8. Vector search results include similarity scores and explanation of relationship
9. Database optimization ensures vector operations complete within reasonable time (<30 seconds)
10. Fallback mechanism handles vector database failures gracefully without breaking analysis

## Story 3.2: Cross-Subreddit Pattern Recognition

As a user validating market demand,
I want to identify the same problems discussed across multiple communities,
so that I can assess market size and opportunity validation confidence.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Pattern recognition algorithm identifies opportunities mentioned across 2+ subreddits
2. Cross-subreddit validation increases opportunity confidence scores with clear indicators
3. Market size indicators estimate total addressable market based on community overlap
4. Pattern analysis shows problem evolution over time across different communities
5. Cross-validation section in reports highlights opportunities with multi-community validation
6. Community-specific variations of same problem identified and analyzed
7. Geographic and demographic pattern recognition where community data available
8. Pattern strength metrics show statistical significance of cross-community validation
9. Visual representation of problem distribution across communities in reports
10. Alert system for emerging patterns that appear across multiple communities simultaneously

## Story 3.3: Unlimited Analysis Scope

As a power user conducting comprehensive market research,
I want to analyze 10+ subreddits with flexible time ranges and custom configurations,
so that I can conduct thorough market analysis without artificial limitations.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Support for analyzing unlimited number of subreddits with cost scaling transparency
2. Custom time ranges including specific date ranges, seasonal analysis, and trend comparison
3. Advanced filtering options: post karma thresholds, comment count minimums, user engagement levels
4. Batch processing for large analyses with progress tracking and estimated completion times
5. Cost estimation and approval workflow scales appropriately for large analyses
6. Performance optimization ensures large analyses complete within reasonable timeframes
7. Partial results delivery if analysis partially fails or is stopped early
8. Analysis templates for common research scenarios (competitor research, market validation, trend analysis)
9. Resource management prevents single large analysis from impacting other users
10. Export capabilities handle large datasets with pagination and filtering options

## Story 3.4: Advanced Opportunity Clustering

As a user analyzing complex market landscapes,
I want opportunities automatically grouped by themes and relationships,
so that I can understand market structure and identify the most promising opportunity clusters.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Machine learning clustering groups opportunities by theme, industry, user persona, and problem type
2. Cluster visualization shows opportunity relationships with interactive exploration
3. Cluster scoring identifies most promising opportunity groups based on multiple factors
4. Cluster analysis includes market size estimation and competitive density assessment
5. Users can adjust clustering parameters (granularity, similarity threshold) with real-time updates
6. Cluster summaries provide actionable insights about each opportunity group
7. Cross-cluster analysis identifies opportunities that bridge multiple market segments
8. Cluster stability metrics ensure consistent grouping across similar analyses
9. Export functionality preserves cluster relationships in structured formats
10. Cluster-based filtering allows users to focus on specific opportunity types or market segments
