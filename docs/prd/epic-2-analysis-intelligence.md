3. Each anti-pattern includes clear explanation and specific evidence from analyzed posts
4. Anti-pattern detection accuracy >85% based on manual validation sample of 100+ opportunities
5. Users can override anti-pattern warnings with explicit acknowledgment and reasoning
6. Anti-pattern summary section in reports shows "Opportunities to Avoid" with rationale
7. Learning system tracks user override patterns to improve anti-pattern detection accuracy
8. Custom anti-pattern rules allow users to add specific criteria for their situation
9. Anti-pattern severity levels (warning vs critical) help users prioritize attention
