# Epic List

Based on comprehensive requirements and battle-tested through multi-perspective analysis, here are the strategically sequenced development phases:

**Epic 1: Core Value MVP** - Reddit analysis with basic AI scoring, simple payment integration, and minimal authentication to prove users will pay for AI-powered opportunity analysis within 6-8 weeks.

**Epic 2: Analysis Intelligence** - Enhanced AI pipeline with comment analysis, 10-dimensional scoring, anti-pattern detection, and comprehensive opportunity reporting to deliver competitive differentiation through analysis depth.

**Epic 3: Discovery & Scale** - Vector database integration, cross-subreddit pattern recognition, unlimited analysis scope, and advanced opportunity clustering to enable platform scalability and advanced insights.

**Epic 4: User Experience & Optimization** - Natural language chat interface, UI polish with dot grid design system, performance optimization, and cost efficiency improvements for user retention and margin improvement.

## Epic Structure Rationale:

**Market Validation Priority:** Epic 1 delivers working analysis with payment validation within 6-8 weeks, enabling rapid market feedback rather than building infrastructure without user validation.

**Balanced Complexity Distribution:** Epic sizing is more evenly distributed, avoiding the "foundation epic" trap that delays value delivery and the "mega-epic" trap that creates development bottlenecks.

**Risk Management:** Core technical risks (AI accuracy, cost tracking, Reddit API integration) are tackled in Epic 1-2 when iteration and pivoting are most feasible.

**Built-in Quality:** Production concerns, monitoring, and error handling are integrated throughout each epic rather than deferred to a separate "production readiness" phase.

**User Feedback Integration:** Each epic delivers deployable value that enables user testing and feedback to guide subsequent development phases.
