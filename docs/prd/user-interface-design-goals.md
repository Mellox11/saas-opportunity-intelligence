# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

**Primary Experience:** Cost-transparent, progress-driven analysis workflow where users feel in control of their spending and can see real-time value delivery. The interface should feel like a professional research tool with modern canvas-based design, emphasizing data quality and actionable insights through visual workflow representation.

**Design Philosophy:** "Transparent Intelligence" - every AI decision, cost calculation, and analysis step should be visible and explainable through intuitive visual workflows, building trust with technically-minded users who appreciate understanding how their tools work.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Modern Visual Design:** Clean, professional interface with subtle dot grid background patterns for visual texture, inspired by modern design portfolios and fintech applications like Mercury.com.

**Cost-First Workflow:** All user interactions begin with cost estimation and budget approval, making spending transparent and predictable before any analysis begins.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Analysis results presented in expandable cards and panels on the canvas, allowing users to drill down from summary to detailed breakdowns to raw data access.

**Conversational Intelligence:** Chat interface integrated into the canvas experience for querying results, supporting both simple questions and complex filters with visual highlighting of relevant data points.

**Real-Time Feedback:** Live progress indicators with cost tracking displayed as animated workflow nodes, showing exactly what the system is doing and how much it's costing.

## Core Screens and Views

**Analysis Configuration Page:** Clean form interface for subreddit selection, time range configuration, and keyword customization with dot-grid background patterns and cost estimation workflow

**Real-Time Progress Dashboard:** Modern dashboard with progress indicators, cost accumulation display, and ability to modify analysis mid-stream

**Opportunity Results Page:** Interactive grid of opportunity cards with filtering, sorting, and detailed view capabilities

**Chat Interface Panel:** Integrated chat sidebar or modal with suggested questions and saved query templates

**Analysis History Grid:** Past reports displayed as card thumbnails with hover previews, cost breakdowns, and quick access to saved opportunities

**Account & Billing Dashboard:** Clean, modern dashboard with usage analytics, cost visualization charts, payment methods, and spending controls

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure compliance with WCAG AA standards with particular attention to dark mode contrast ratios and canvas-based interaction accessibility patterns.

## Branding

**Visual Style:** Modern, clean aesthetic with subtle dot grid background patterns for visual texture. Clean typography, subtle shadows, and smooth animations create a premium feel that communicates "intelligent analysis." Alternative inspiration from Mercury.com's sophisticated fintech design.

**Color Scheme:** Comprehensive dark/light mode support with carefully calibrated contrast ratios. Dark mode as the default experience for developer-focused audience.

**Interactive Elements:** Smooth transitions, hover effects, and micro-interactions that feel responsive and polished without being distracting from data analysis tasks.

**Design Elements:** Dot grid backgrounds as subtle texture, rounded corner cards, subtle gradients, and clean spacing to create professional, modern appearance.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary:** Desktop-first responsive web application optimized for detailed analysis review and data exploration

**Secondary:** Tablet support for report reviewing and basic querying

**Dark Mode:** Full dark mode implementation as default, with light mode toggle available

**Out of Scope:** Native mobile apps (analysis complexity better suited for larger screens)
