# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1:** The system shall collect Reddit data with user-configurable scope (subreddits, timeframes, keyword filters) and provide real-time progress tracking with cost accumulation display

**FR2:** The system shall filter Reddit content using pre-built pain point keyword lists ("I hate," "I need a tool," "frustrating") with user-customizable keyword additions

**FR3:** The system shall classify Reddit posts for SaaS feasibility using AI with binary classification and confidence scores

**FR4:** The system shall perform 10-dimensional problem analysis extracting persona, emotion level, market size indicators, technical complexity, existing solutions, budget context, industry vertical, user role, time sensitivity, and workflow stage

**FR5:** The system shall generate opportunity scores (1-100 scale) with minimum 70% user satisfaction rate and provide confidence intervals for each scoring dimension

**FR6:** The system shall analyze comment threads for high-scoring posts using the same AI classification pipeline for additional validation signals

**FR7:** The system shall store posts and comments in separate vector databases using Pinecone with OpenAI embeddings for semantic search

**FR8:** The system shall provide interactive chat interface for natural language querying of opportunity data

**FR9:** The system shall detect cross-subreddit patterns and cluster related opportunities for comprehensive analysis

**FR10:** The system shall generate comprehensive reports with opportunity cards showing problem title, score, market signals, pain evidence, suggested solutions, and anti-pattern warnings

**FR11:** The system shall flag anti-pattern opportunities including free alternatives, enterprise-only requirements, one-time needs, over-saturated markets, and regulation-heavy industries

**FR12:** The system shall implement cost estimation with user-approved spending limits, automatic stopping at budget caps, and itemized cost breakdowns showing Reddit API, OpenAI, and processing costs separately

**FR13:** The system shall process payments using usage-based billing with 4x cost-plus pricing model and detailed cost breakdowns

**FR14:** The system shall support user authentication, account management, and analysis history tracking

**FR15:** The system shall provide comprehensive error handling for API failures with graceful degradation and partial results delivery when possible

**FR16:** The system shall enable users to save, share, and export analysis results in multiple formats (PDF, JSON, CSV) with configurable privacy settings

**FR17:** The system shall implement analysis queue management with priority handling and estimated completion times for concurrent users

## Non Functional

**NFR1:** The system shall complete standard opportunity analyses within 5-10 minutes from initiation to report delivery

**NFR2:** The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours with graceful degradation during peak loads

**NFR3:** The system shall support 50+ concurrent users with automated horizontal scaling, maintaining <30 second queue wait times during peak loads

**NFR4:** The system shall provide real-time cost estimation with <2 second response time

**NFR5:** The system shall maintain cost estimation accuracy within 20% of actual API consumption

**NFR6:** The system shall achieve 75%+ gross margins on usage-based pricing model

**NFR7:** The system shall comply with Reddit API rate limits (100 requests per minute for authenticated apps)

**NFR8:** The system shall encrypt user data at rest and in transit with industry-standard security practices

**NFR9:** The system shall maintain GDPR compliance for EU users and PCI compliance for payment processing

**NFR10:** The system shall implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for system health and cost tracking

**NFR11:** The system shall maintain AI classification accuracy above 70% user satisfaction rate measured through post-analysis feedback surveys

**NFR12:** The system shall implement comprehensive audit logging for all financial transactions, API calls, and user actions for compliance and debugging

**NFR13:** The system shall provide 99.9% data integrity guarantees with automated backup and recovery procedures
