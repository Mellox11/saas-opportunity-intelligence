# Story 1.3: Cost Estimation & Budget Approval

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** cost-conscious indie hacker,
**I want** to see estimated costs before starting analysis,
**I want** to set spending limits and approve charges,
**so that** I can control my expenses and avoid surprises.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Cost estimation calculator shows breakdown: Reddit API ($X), AI Analysis ($Y), Total ($Z)
2. Cost calculation updates in real-time as user modifies analysis scope
3. User can set maximum spending limit with slider or input field
4. Clear warning if estimated cost exceeds user-defined budget
5. Cost approval modal with itemized breakdown before starting analysis
6. "Proceed" button disabled until user explicitly approves estimated cost
7. Cost estimation accuracy within 25% of actual charges (tracked for improvement)
8. Progress indicator shows cost accumulation during analysis
9. Automatic stop mechanism if actual costs approach user-approved limit

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.reddit-data-collection-configuration.story.md#completion-notes]
- Configuration system stores data in analyses table with JSONB fields
- Real-time preview functionality implemented with ConfigurationPreview component
- Form validation patterns established with Zod schemas
- API structure in place with consistent error handling
- User preferences JSONB field available for budget storage
- All UI components follow Mercury.com-inspired dark theme

### Cost Calculation Model
[Source: docs/architecture/backend/6-cost-analysis.md#L19-41]
```typescript
function calculateUnitEconomics(monthlyAnalyses: number, pricePerAnalysis: number) {
  const revenue = monthlyAnalyses * pricePerAnalysis
  
  const costs = {
    reddit: monthlyAnalyses * 0.012,      // $0.012 per analysis
    ai: monthlyAnalyses * 1.40,           // $1.40 per analysis (30% savings via AI SDK)
    infrastructure: 159,                   // Updated fixed monthly cost
    total: 0
  }
  
  costs.total = costs.reddit + costs.ai + costs.infrastructure
  const grossMargin = revenue - costs.total
  const grossMarginPercent = (grossMargin / revenue) * 100
  
  return { revenue, costs, grossMargin, grossMarginPercent }
}
```
- Reddit API: $0.012 per analysis (100 requests estimate)
- AI Processing: $1.40 per analysis (with Vercel AI SDK optimization)
- Apply 4x markup for transparent pricing: ($0.012 + $1.40) * 4 = $5.65 per analysis

### Database Schema for Cost Tracking
[Source: docs/architecture/backend/1-data-models-database-schema.md#L26-45, L124-167]
```sql
-- Analyses table already has cost fields
CREATE TABLE analyses (
    estimated_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    actual_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    budget_limit DECIMAL(10,2),
    progress JSONB DEFAULT '{}', -- track cost accumulation here
    -- other fields...
);

-- Cost events for detailed tracking
CREATE TABLE cost_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    analysis_id UUID REFERENCES analyses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    event_type cost_event_type NOT NULL, -- 'reddit_api_request', 'openai_tokens', etc.
    provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    unit_cost DECIMAL(10,6) NOT NULL,
    total_cost DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Payments table for later integration (Story 1.5)
CREATE TABLE payments (
    stripe_payment_intent_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    cost_breakdown JSONB NOT NULL, -- itemized costs
    -- other fields...
);
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/backend/2-api-design-integration-patterns.md]
New API endpoints to implement:
- `POST /api/cost/estimate` - Calculate estimated costs for configuration
- `POST /api/analysis/approve-cost` - Record user's cost approval
- `GET /api/cost/tracking/:analysisId` - Get real-time cost accumulation
- `POST /api/cost/events` - Record cost events during processing

Cost estimation request/response:
```typescript
// Request
interface CostEstimateRequest {
  configuration: {
    subreddits: string[]
    timeRange: 30 | 60 | 90
    keywords: {
      predefined: string[]
      custom: string[]
    }
  }
}

// Response
interface CostEstimateResponse {
  breakdown: {
    reddit: number
    ai: number
    total: number
  }
  finalPrice: number  // with 4x markup
  currency: 'USD'
  accuracy: number    // historical accuracy percentage
}
```

### Component Specifications

File locations for new components:
```
app/(dashboard)/analysis/new/components/
├── CostEstimator.tsx        # Main cost estimation display
├── CostBreakdown.tsx        # Itemized cost breakdown
├── BudgetSelector.tsx       # Budget limit selector
├── CostApprovalModal.tsx    # Cost approval workflow

components/billing/
├── CostDisplay.tsx          # Reusable cost display component
├── BudgetWarning.tsx        # Budget exceeded warning
```

### Design System Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend/10-component-architecture-design-system.md#L6-76]
Use established design tokens:
- Success colors (`success.500` #22c55e) for costs within budget
- Warning colors (`warning.500` #f59e0b) for approaching budget limit
- Error colors (`error.500` #ef4444) for exceeding budget
- Gray backgrounds (`gray.800` #1f2937, `gray.900` #111827)
- Animation durations (fast: 150ms, normal: 300ms)

### Validation Schemas
[Source: docs/architecture/backend/4-security-authentication.md#validation-patterns]
Create Zod schemas:
```typescript
// lib/validation/cost-schema.ts
export const costEstimateSchema = z.object({
  configuration: configurationSchema, // reuse from analysis-schema
  budgetLimit: z.number().min(1).max(1000).optional()
})

export const costApprovalSchema = z.object({
  analysisId: z.string().uuid(),
  estimatedCost: z.number().positive(),
  approvedBudget: z.number().positive(),
  acknowledged: z.boolean().refine(val => val === true, {
    message: 'Cost approval must be acknowledged'
  })
})
```

### State Management
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend/11-state-management-architecture.md]
Integrate with existing React Query patterns:
- Use `useMutation` for cost estimation API calls
- Cache cost estimates with 5-minute stale time
- Optimistic updates for budget changes
- Real-time cost tracking via WebSocket subscription

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend/13-testing-strategy-quality-assurance.md]
- Unit tests for cost calculation utilities in `__tests__/utils/cost-calculator.test.ts`
- Component tests for CostEstimator, BudgetSelector, CostApprovalModal
- Integration tests for cost approval workflow
- E2E tests for complete cost estimation and approval flow
- Mock external API responses for consistent testing
- Test circuit breaker triggers with simulated cost overruns

### Security Considerations
- Never expose actual provider costs to client
- All cost calculations server-side only
- Validate budget limits to prevent negative or excessive values
- Audit log all cost approvals and budget changes
- Rate limit cost estimation endpoints to prevent abuse
