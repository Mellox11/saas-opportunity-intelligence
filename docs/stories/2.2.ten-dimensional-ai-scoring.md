Done

## Story
**As a** user wanting detailed opportunity assessment,
**I want** comprehensive scoring across 10 business dimensions,
**so that** I can make data-driven decisions about which opportunities to pursue.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AI extracts and analyzes: persona (classification), emotion level (score), market size indicators (score), technical complexity (score), existing solutions (score), budget context (score), industry vertical (classification), user role (classification), time sensitivity (score), workflow stage (classification)
2. Scored dimensions rated 1-10 with confidence intervals; classified dimensions labeled with specific values and supporting evidence
3. Weighted composite score (1-100) with default weights optimized for SaaS viability
4. Analysis rationale provided for each dimension with specific quotes and reasoning (scores or classifications)
5. Dimension breakdown displayed in expandable accordion sections of opportunity cards
6. Historical scoring consistency tracked and reported for quality improvement metrics
7. User feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down) to validate scoring accuracy per dimension
8. Dimension definitions and scoring criteria accessible via help tooltips and documentation
9. Scoring algorithm handles edge cases and missing information gracefully
10. Quality metrics show scoring confidence and reliability for each opportunity

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 established comment analysis infrastructure that provides additional context signals for dimensional scoring. The comment sentiment and validation signals from Story 2.1 can enhance dimension accuracy, particularly for emotion level and market validation dimensions.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/backend/1-data-models-database-schema.md#ai-analysis-results]

The existing `opportunities` table already includes `scoring_dimensions JSONB NOT NULL` field. This story will define the complete structure:

```typescript
interface DimensionalAnalysis {
  // Classified dimensions (categorical)
  persona: DimensionClassification
  industryVertical: DimensionClassification
  userRole: DimensionClassification
  workflowStage: DimensionClassification
  
  // Scored dimensions (1-10 scale)
  emotionLevel: DimensionScore
  marketSize: DimensionScore
  technicalComplexity: DimensionScore
  existingSolutions: DimensionScore
  budgetContext: DimensionScore
  timeSensitivity: DimensionScore
  
  // Meta-analysis information
  compositeScore: number // 1-100 weighted score (only from scored dimensions)
  confidenceScore: number // 0-1 overall confidence
  analysisVersion: string // For tracking analysis model versions
  processingTime: number // Milliseconds for performance tracking
}

interface DimensionClassification {
  value: string // e.g., "dogwalker", "software-engineer", "retail"
  confidence: number // 0-1 confidence level
  evidence: string[] // Supporting quotes from content
  reasoning: string // AI rationale for classification
  alternatives?: string[] // Other possible classifications considered
  feedback?: {
    userRating: 'positive' | 'negative' | null
    userId: string
    timestamp: string
  }[]
}

interface DimensionScore {
  score: number // 1-10 scale
  confidence: number // 0-1 confidence level
  evidence: string[] // Supporting quotes from content
  reasoning: string // AI rationale for score
  weight: number // Dimension weight in composite calculation
  feedback?: {
    userRating: 'positive' | 'negative' | null
    userId: string
    timestamp: string
  }[]
}
```

**Example Analysis Output:**
```json
{
  "persona": { "value": "dogwalker", "confidence": 0.92, "evidence": ["I walk dogs for a living", "my clients are pet owners"], "reasoning": "User explicitly states they are a professional dog walker" },
  "industryVertical": { "value": "pet-services", "confidence": 0.88, "evidence": ["dog walking business"], "reasoning": "Clear pet services industry" },
  "userRole": { "value": "service-provider", "confidence": 0.90, "evidence": ["I provide dog walking services"], "reasoning": "User is a service provider, not consumer" },
  "workflowStage": { "value": "growth-optimization", "confidence": 0.85, "evidence": ["looking for tips on how to get clients"], "reasoning": "User is past startup phase, focused on client acquisition" },
  "emotionLevel": { "score": 6, "confidence": 0.78, "evidence": ["struggling to find new clients"], "reasoning": "Moderate frustration indicated" },
  "marketSize": { "score": 7, "confidence": 0.82, "evidence": ["pet industry is growing"], "reasoning": "Large and growing market" },
  "budgetContext": { "score": 5, "confidence": 0.70, "evidence": ["small business owner"], "reasoning": "Limited budget but willing to invest in growth" },
  "compositeScore": 64
}
```

**Additional Database Extensions:**
- Add `dimension_feedback` table for tracking user validation

**Enhanced AI Service Architecture:**
```typescript
// lib/ai/dimensional-analysis.service.ts
export class DimensionalAnalysisService {
  private readonly dimensionPrompts = {
    // Classification prompts
    persona: "Identify the specific persona/role of the person with this problem (e.g., 'dogwalker', 'small-business-owner', 'freelance-designer')...",
    industryVertical: "Classify the industry vertical (e.g., 'healthcare', 'e-commerce', 'education', 'retail')...",

      temperature: 0.2 // Lower temperature for consistent analysis
    })
  }
}
```

### Weighted Scoring Algorithm
**Default SaaS-Optimized Weights (for scored dimensions only):**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_SCORED_DIMENSION_WEIGHTS = {
  emotionLevel: 0.20, // Strong pain indicates willingness to pay
  marketSize: 0.25, // Essential for SaaS scalability
  technicalComplexity: 0.15, // Lower complexity = faster MVP
  existingSolutions: 0.20, // Market validation but competition risk
  budgetContext: 0.15, // Critical for revenue potential
  timeSensitivity: 0.05, // Urgency drives faster adoption
} // Total: 1.00

// Classified dimensions provide context but don't contribute to composite score
// - persona: Used for market segmentation and targeting
// - industryVertical: Used for domain-specific insights
// - userRole: Used for sales approach and messaging
// - workflowStage: Used for timing and positioning strategy
```

### UI Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend/10-component-architecture-design-system.md#component-composition-patterns]

**Expandable Dimension Display:**
```typescript
// components/analysis/dimension-accordion.tsx
interface DimensionAccordionProps {
  dimensions: DimensionalScoring
  onFeedback: (dimension: string, rating: 'positive' | 'negative') => void
  showHelp?: boolean
}

// Design system integration:
// - Mercury.com inspired accordion with smooth transitions
// - Dot grid background patterns for visual hierarchy
// - Professional fintech color scheme (gray.800, gray.900)
// - Animation duration: 300ms for accordion expand/collapse
```

### File Locations

### Cost Tracking Integration
**Dimensional Scoring Cost Impact:**
- AI Processing: ~2,000 tokens per opportunity for 10-dimension analysis
- Claude-3 Sonnet: $3.00 per 1M tokens = $0.006 per opportunity
- Estimated 25% increase in AI processing costs for comprehensive scoring
- Additional storage costs for dimension feedback and consistency metrics

### User Feedback System
**Feedback Collection Strategy:**
```typescript
interface DimensionFeedback {
  opportunityId: string
  dimension: keyof DimensionalScoring
  userRating: 'positive' | 'negative'
  userId: string
  timestamp: Date
  optionalComment?: string
}

// Feedback aggregation for scoring improvement:
// - Track accuracy per dimension across users
// - Identify consistently problematic scoring areas
// - Generate training data for model improvement
// - Alert when dimension accuracy drops below 80%
```

### Quality Metrics and Consistency Tracking
