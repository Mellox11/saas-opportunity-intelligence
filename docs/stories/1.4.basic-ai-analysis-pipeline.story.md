# Story 1.4: Basic AI Analysis Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user seeking validated opportunities,
**I want** the system to analyze Reddit posts for SaaS feasibility and basic scoring,
**so that** I can identify promising opportunities without manual research.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System collects Reddit posts from configured subreddits within time range
2. Keyword filtering removes posts not matching pain point criteria
3. AI classifies posts for SaaS feasibility (binary classification with confidence)
4. Basic opportunity scoring on 3 key dimensions: urgency, market signals, feasibility
5. Posts scored above threshold (70+) included in final analysis
6. Real-time progress tracking shows current processing stage and estimated completion
7. Error handling for Reddit API failures with partial results delivery
8. Analysis completes within 10 minutes for standard configuration (2 subreddits, 30 days)
9. System stores analysis results for user access and future reference
10. Circuit breaker prevents runaway costs if AI processing fails

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - This is a sophisticated, well-architected implementation that demonstrates senior-level design patterns and engineering practices. The code follows clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and robust cost tracking integration.

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent service architecture with clear responsibility boundaries
- Proper schema validation using Zod throughout
- Comprehensive cost tracking and circuit breaker implementation
- Well-structured queue architecture with Bull.js and Redis
- Professional-grade error handling and retry logic
- Good use of TypeScript for type safety

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `lib/services/ai-processing.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Refactored `storeOpportunities` method to use batch insert with `createMany`
  - **Why**: The original implementation used individual `create` calls in a loop, which is inefficient for database operations
  - **How**: Replaced with batch insert using `createMany` with `skipDuplicates: true` for better performance and atomic operations

- **File**: `lib/services/reddit-client.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling in `collectPostsFromSubreddits` with retry logic and exponential backoff
  - **Why**: Original implementation had basic error handling that could fail entire subreddit collection on transient errors
  - **How**: Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff, error tracking, and graceful degradation

- **File**: `app/api/analysis/[id]/progress-stream/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Created missing Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time progress updates
  - **Why**: Story requirement AC#6 specified real-time progress tracking, but SSE implementation was missing
  - **How**: Implemented proper SSE endpoint with progress polling, connection management, and error handling

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✓** Excellent adherence to TypeScript/Next.js best practices
- Project Structure: **✓** Follows established patterns with proper file organization  
- Testing Strategy: **✓** Good test coverage with proper mocking and edge case handling

2. **✓ Keyword filtering** - Robust filtering logic with case-insensitive matching
3. **✓ AI classifies posts for SaaS feasibility** - GPT-4 integration with structured output schema
4. **✓ Basic opportunity scoring** - 3-dimensional scoring with configurable weights
5. **✓ Posts scored above 70+ threshold** - Implemented with proper filtering logic
6. **✓ Real-time progress tracking** - Progress updates via database + new SSE endpoint added
7. **✓ Error handling for Reddit API failures** - Comprehensive retry logic and partial results
8. **✓ 10-minute completion target** - Architecture supports this with queue processing
9. **✓ System stores analysis results** - Proper database schema and relationships
10. **✓ Circuit breaker prevents runaway costs** - Integrated with cost tracking service

### Improvements Checklist
